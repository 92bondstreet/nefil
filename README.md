## 🏗️  Installation

```sh
❯ git clone git@github.com:92bondstreet/nefil.git
❯ make install
```

**Note:**

* Bootstrapped with [create-react-app 3.0.1](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)
* Based on [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) (at least React 16.8)
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) is the package manager
* [react-scripts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-scripts) is replaced by [rescripts](https://github.com/harrysolovay/rescripts) to allows us to customize the CRA setup without ejecting
* Update the `.webpack.config.js` with `electron-renderer` as [target](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/target/)
